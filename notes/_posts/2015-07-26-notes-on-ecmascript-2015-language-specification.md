# Section 4

> ECMAScript is an **object-oriented** programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a host environment.

> ECMAScript is **object-based**: basic language and host facilities are provided by objects, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects.

> An *ordinary object* is object that has the default behaviour for the essential internal methods that must be supported by all objects. An *exotic object* is object that does not have the default behaviour for one or more of the essential internal methods that must be supported by all objects. Any object that is not an ordinary object is an exotic object.
